# Introduction to Eleventy (11ty)

An introduction to Eleventy for my course / workshop at IAD (the scool I teach in).

I intend to keep this public and maintain it for the foreseeable future, like my other course materials.

Feel free to [report an issue](https://github.com/jeromecoupe/iad_eleventy_introduction/issues) or to submit a pull request if you see anything that could be improved.
